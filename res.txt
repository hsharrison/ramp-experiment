\subsubsection{Method}

\paragraph{Participants}
Ten University of Connecticut undergraduate students between the 
ages of 18 and 26 participated in the study, 
in partial fulfillment of a course 
requirement. Six participants were male and four female. The experiment 
was conducted with the approval of the University of Connecticut 
Institutional Review Board.

\paragraph{Materials}
A wooden dowel 121.92~cm in length and 1.59~cm in diamter was 
used for dynamic-touch trials. A felt+++???+++velt blindfold was used on 
dynamic-touch trials to eliminate visual information, and on visual 
trials while the experimenters adjusted the slope of the surface. 
Participants wore circumaural headphones playing white noise to eliminate 
auditory information while the experimenters adjusted the slope. Beeping
 noises were also played through the headphones to signal the start of 
each trial.  Participants indicated their responses by pressing a button
 on a Logitech wireless presentation remote. A PC running custom software
 written in Python controlled the audio and recorded participants' 
responses and response times.

\paragraph{Apparatus}
The apparatus consisted of a solid wooden 75.88~cm x 210.19~cm platform 
leaned on a heavy metal block. The slope of the platform was adjusted by
 sliding the block along the floor. For seven angles of 
inclination --- $12^\circ$, $17^\circ$, $22^\circ$, $27^\circ$, $33^\circ$,
$39^\circ$, and $45^\circ$, the corresponding position of the block was 
determined and marked on the floor so it could be quickly recreated. The 
apparatus was strong and stable enough to support a person's weight. A 
rubber mat was attached to the platform in order to increase friction.

\paragraph{Design and procedure}
The participant's task in this experiment was to determine whether a surface would support stable upright posture, defined as maintaining balance while standing with feet flat and parallel.


The participant perceived the slope either visually or haptically, 
by exploring the surface with a dowel. 
{\color{red} In order to explore the slope, the participants were allowed
to touch the slope with the tip of the dowel.}
In both types of trials, 
participants stood with their heels 1~m away from the slope. 
They wore a blindfold and listened to white noise while the experimenters 
adjusted the slope of the surface. For haptic trials, the participants were 
instructed to hold the dowel touching the floor and the side of their foot 
during this time. An experimenter pressed a button on the PC to indicate 
that the slope was ready, pausing the white noise. After a random delay 
of 0.5~s-1.5~s, the participant heard a beep indicating the start of the 
trial. For visual trials, the participant lifted the blindfold at the 
sound of the beep; for haptic trials, the participant lifted the dowel 
and began exploring the slope.

The participants indicated their responses by pressing one of 
two buttons on the presentation remote, having previously been 
instructed that a right button press indicated that the ramp could support upright posture,
while a left button press indicated that it could not. 
%Participants 
%then indicated the degree of confidence in their judgments by speaking aloud 
%a number from one to seven, where one indicated they were basically 
%guessing and seven indicated they were very confident. An experimenter 
%recorded this number, at which point the white noise was 
%resumed and the 
Subsequently, participants returned their blindfold to their eyes (visual
condition) or 
the dowel to the initial position (haptic condition). 
The experimenters then adjusted the 
%The PC then displayed 
the angle of 
inclination of the slope for the next trial.

Response time was recorded beginning with the beep and ending when a 
button on the presentation remote was pressed. Participants were not 
asked to respond quickly; the instructions did not address the speed of 
the response in any way.

Seven angles of inclination were crossed with two modes of perception for a 
total of 14 experimental conditions. Each condition was repeated three 
times for a total of 42 trials per participant. Haptic and 
visual trials were conducted in separate blocks. Half the 
participants began with the visual trials and half began 
with the haptic trials. Angle of inclination was randomized within each block.


At the end of each session, the participant's maximum 
angle of inclination allowing upriht posture was estimated.
Beginning with the smallest angle, the
participant attempted to stand on the platform. If the participant was able to
achieve stable upright posture, the angle of inclination was increased. If the
participant was not able to achieve stable upright posture within two
attempts, the previous angle was recorded as the participant's maximum
possible 
angle
of inclination. 
%Participants accomodate the slope by bending at both the
%hip and the ankle, unlike in Fitzpatrick and Carello (1994), 
%in which participants were only permitted to bend at the ankle.
Note that in order to stand on the platform, participants were allowed to
bend their bodies both at the
hip and the ankle. This was different from the study by 
Fitzpatrick and Carello~\cite{xxx}, 
in which participants were only allowed to bend at the ankle.
Our procedure more closely reflects real-world standing on inclinded surfaces, and is also safer.

\subsubsection{Results}
Data were checked for outliers. In this step,
data from one partipant was excluded from any analyses 
because that participant dominated the results by taking more 
than three times the standard deviation longer than the mean 
response time for almost every trial. For each of the remaining 9 
participants, 
the proportion of "yes" responses 
%as well as the mean confidence judgment 
and the mean response time 
was calculated for each of the 14 experimental 
conditions.  

Figure~\ref{fig:pct} 
shows the percentage of "yes" responses as function of the inclination angle
for the visual and haptic conditions. The percentage of "yes" responses
decayed more or less monotonically with increasing inclination angle.
The pattern of responses were similar between the haptic and 
visual modes of perception. 


The perceived maximum possible 
angles 
of inclination, defined as the angle of inclination resulting 
in 50\% yes responses, was estimated using linear interpolation. This 
was estimated to be $26.04^\circ$ for visual perception and $27.75^\circ$ for 
haptic perception. The actual maximum stable angle 
The maximum possible angle
of inclination, 
averaged across participants, was $30.33^\circ$.


For hypothesis testing purposes, 
the resulting proportions of "yes" responses were 
arcsine-transformed according to $p'=\arcsin \sqrt{p}$, where $p$ is 
the proportion of "yes" responses. This transformation normalizes 
proportion data. A $2 \times 7$ (perception mode $\times$ angle of inclination) 
within-subjects ANOVA
revealed no 
significant main effect of perception mode on proportion of "yes" 
responses, $F(1, 8) = 1.47$, $p > .05$. The main effect of angle 
of inclination on proportion of "yes" responses was significant, $F(6, 48) =
29.42$, $p < .0001$. The effect on proportion of "yes" responses of 
the interaction between angle of inclination and mode of perception 
was not significant, $F(6, 48) = 0.83$, $p > .05$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:rt} shows
response times by inclination angle and condition.
First of all, Figure~\ref{fig:rt} 
indicates consistently longer response times for
haptic perception than for visual perception. Second, the graphs showed a
more or less pronounced 
peaked. The maximum average response
times occurred at $27^\circ$ 
for both haptic and visual perception, closely
matching the perceived maximum possible angles 
of inclination of $27.75^\circ$
and $26.04^\circ$, respectively. 

A $2 \times 7$ (perception mode $\times$ angle of inclination)
within-subjects ANOVA
was performed on response times, finding a
significant main effect of mode of perception, $F(1,8) = 25.32$, $p<.01$
and no significant main effect of angle of inclination, $F(6, 48) = 2.20$, $p
= .059$. The interaction between angle of inclination and perception mode was
not significant, $F(6, 48) = 0.55$, $p > .05$.
